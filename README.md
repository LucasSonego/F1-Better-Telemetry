### Users guide

This software uses the live telemetry that you can export from the game,
so you will need to enable this feature on the game settings.

Go to **Settings** and select **Telemetry Settings**
Set the **UDP Telemetry** to "on". The UDP IP address should be `127.0.0.1` and the Port should be `20777`.
You can also change the "UDP Send rate", that controls the amount of times per second that the data will be updated, **10Hz** is the recomended rate for this software.
